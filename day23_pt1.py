# I am currently thinking of just implementing the problem with dijkstra's algorithm, idk tho
# Attempted to work it out on paper and got 20715, but it is too high
# With another paper working attempt I got 18919, but still too high
# With third try on paper I got 18275, but still too high
# Fourth try on paper, 18239, still too high
# Fifth try, 18197, not right
# Sixth try, with some optimisation, 18195, I got it right!
# I think that its time to start attempting to program it
# Honestly I have no idea how to start implementing this
# I did it all on paper because I was kinda lazy and unsure how to program it
